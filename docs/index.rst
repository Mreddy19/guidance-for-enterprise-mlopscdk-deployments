AWS Enterprise MLOps Platform
=============================

The AWS Enterprise MLOps Platform is the infrastructure required to operate ML at scale within an Enterprise. It sets up and configures native AWS managed services such as Amazon SageMaker, accelerating the process of using these tools in your organisation. It consists of a managed, secure environment within an isolated VPC, different access for different user personas, managed projects with isolated resources, and pre-configured CI/CD processes. 

The main design feature is a separation of concerns between the data scientists who focus on building models and running experiments, and the automated infrastructure which deploys those models into production using CI/CD.
